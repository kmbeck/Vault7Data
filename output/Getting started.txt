                        Making a template

    
        
            Give your authors a helping hand by using templates in your documentation space. You will need Space Administrator permissions to create templates.
            To create a template:
            
                Go to "Space Tools" in the sidebar, select "Content Tools" and create a new template.
                Click "Page Layout" and add sections and columns to your page.
                Add headings and sub-headings as needed.
                Choose "Instructional Text" from the "Template" menu and add text that is only visible in the editor.
                Save your template.
            
            Your template will become available in the Create dialog for this space.
