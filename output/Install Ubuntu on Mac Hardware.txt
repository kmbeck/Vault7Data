Install Wiresharksudo apt-get install wireshark

Create a wireshark groupsudo groupadd wireshark

Add your username to the wireshark groupsudo usermod -a -G wireshark YOUR_USERNAME

Change the group ownership of the file dumpcap to wiresharksudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap

Chage the mode of the file dumpcap to allow execution by the group wiresharksudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap

Grant capabilities with setcapsudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap

Verify the changesudo getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap

Reboot
