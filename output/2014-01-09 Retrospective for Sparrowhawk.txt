Retrospective



What did we do well?

common userspace client components, eased porting to new platform
use of automated build tool (GNU Autotools)
accessibility of project lead resources for consultation
Solaris platform solution: STREAMS modulesvery portable across Solaris versions and architectures




What should we have done better?
Requirements 

initial requirement drawn for too many different platforms at once
8 in all: Solaris 8,9,10,11 on sparc; Solaris 10,11 on x86 (32/64bit)
Solaris 11 on 32-bit x86 not supported by Oracle
would this have been better as incremental delivery?
unsuccessful delivery to Solaris 8 sparc


lacked incorporation of regular customer demosprevent drift from customer expectation

assumptions made about requirements
that local console is always handled virtually
/dev/console does not always use the pseudoterminal driver (pts)
additional time spent adding code to manually attach module to local console



Resources/Deliveries


 Autotools only partially implemented across the product

Autotools creates additional complexity, build requirements
A partially automated build process cannot be automated across build servers


lack of automated testing capabilitydifficult to test across multiple platforms

lack of available Sparc/Solaris resources hardware for development
either undocumented, outdated, or "claimed" for other projects
Solaris 8 04/04 (last release) not purchased by AED, obtained from IV&V
Mirror of Sun Freeware packages outdated


OpenOffice for documentation is not cooperative
documentation should be clear & concise, meant to be read
Option: Plaintext documentation standards
can be held/tracked in source control
README, INSTALL, GOTCHAS : plain text (markdown?)


Option: Confluence export to PDF



Coding Style/Preferences 

use of forward declarations of exposed component functions
why not expose through C header files?
components should have single responsibility, encapsulate functionality


wholesale copying of code from publicly available proof-of-concept (POCPoint of Contact, Proof of Concept)
building does not equal working
no break from POC, strings and other signatures need to be removed


debug/error handling capability neededcumbersome syntax for debug macros

compiler specific instructions
GCC-specific structure packing produced problems across different platforms
Solaris dev tools (cc) did not honor structure packing


different compilers used for different components
Solaris dev tools (cc) used for kernel component -- is this necessary?
GCC did not seem to compile a working kernel module -- more research?


keeping code DRY (don't repeat yourself)
swabbing endianness of bytes back and forth as needed instead of only once
opening/closing file descriptors for devices multiple times
common structures used in both userspace & kernel defined by separate files


use of plain integer (int) type for data values

sufficient only preferred if size, sign, or endianness of value are never used
clearer intent with types that include sign & bit length: int32_t, uint32_t, etc.

User #11628962: Also dependent on APIApplication Programming Interface requirements






What will we do differently next time to improve?


ID
Status
Task


1
incomplete
Due diligence on incoming requirements to scope platform support to logical constraints.


8
incomplete
Scope requirements to do incremental delivery of platforms.


2
incomplete
Incorporate regular customer demonstrations during development to prevent drift from customer expectation.


3
incomplete
Recapitalize all Sun/Sparc hardware for Solaris into reusable shared infrastructure for building and testing of Solaris applications.


4
incomplete
Obtain reliable mirror of Solaris packages (OpenCSW?) that can be updated.


5
incomplete
Decide (as a division) if AEDApplied Engineering Devision will support Solaris as a development target for future requirements. 


9
incomplete
Consider communication method to keep Project Management/Leadership informed of progress (or lack thereof), schedule, hurdles.   Are Jira metrics the solution for this?

[User #524297]: 

When I finished the sprint out in Jira, it asked me to create a Retrospective page.  There's something iffy w/ the rendering on the Retrospectives page within the EDBEmbedded Devices Branch Space however. When I figure out better instructions, I'll let you know.

Inquiring minds (me) want to know... how'd you add dat fancy JIRA link?!?
